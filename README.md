# Zepto-Data-Analysis

# Summary
This Power BI dashboard analyzes retail sales data, focusing on total sales, item types, outlet performance, and key metrics. I chose this dataset to explore trends in sales, outlet sizes, and customer preferences using interactive visualizations, DAX calculations, and filters for insightful business decision-making. Optimized for clarity and performance. ðŸš€

# DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for Measures & Calculations
1. Avg Rating = AVERAGE('Zepto Grocery Data'[Rating])
2. Avg Sales = AVERAGE('Zepto Grocery Data'[Sales])
3. No of Items = COUNTROWS('Zepto Grocery Data')
4. Total Sales = SUM('Zepto Grocery Data'[Sales]) 


# Data Visualization & Storytelling
Used different Power BI visuals to present insights effectively:
KPI Cards: For quick stats (Total Sales, No. of Items, Avg Rating)
Line Chart: Outlet establishment trend over time
Bar Chart: Item type comparison based on sales
Pie Charts: Outlet size contribution to sales
Stacked Bars & Donut Charts: Outlet identifiers by year

# Filters & Slicers for Interactivity
Where Used?
Filter Pane on the Left: Allows users to filter by Outlet Location, Outlet Size, and Item Type.

# Advanced Insights using Conditional Formatting
Color-coded Metrics:
Different colors for various outlet sizes in the pie chart.
Conditional formatting in the matrix table for Avg Sales and Item Visibility.
